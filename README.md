# TSH Technical Recruitment Task

## Intro

Hi, I'm happy to see you here! :)

## What is done

Might be that some things weren't necessary to do for a recruitment task. It was mentioned that it's better to keep further development and scalability in mind, though.

So here we are with:

- authentication integrated with the provided API
  > "The login button doesn't have to do anything" - yet it does
- Material UI as, well, the UI part
- products with searching, filtering, pagination and a debouncer over all that
- internationalization (though for now there's only a JSON for English)
- business logic as a completely separate, UI-independent layer
- fully reactive data flow

## What isn't done

E2E tests. Sorry for that. I didn't want you to wait longer because of the testing aspect.

_We can still talk about them, though._

## What might have been done better

Unit tests. I mean, there would be more of them. The reason is same as for E2E tests.

There's also a thing about the architecture itself. I prefer a slightly different approach, so that there are no repetitions in the import path. It's done the way it is just to comply with the starter's manners.

## Bottom line

Let's talk. I'll try to answer all of the questions you may want to ask.

Thank you for reading this one. :)
